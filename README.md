OneSkyAppSharp
==============
OneSkyAppSharp is a mono compatible implementation of the OneSkyApp API written in C#.

### Repository Structure
* __OneSkyAppSharp__: This is the main library project that contains all implemented OneSkyApp API calls.
* __OneSkyAppTool__: This is a console app project that can be used to automate build processes by downloading localization files using the OneSkyApp API.

### State of the library
Because this library is mainly developed for my own purposes, only the functions I personally use are currently implemented. However, pull requests are very welcome!
