OneSkyAppSharp
==============
OneSkyAppSharp is a mono compatible implementation of the [OneSky API](https://github.com/onesky/api-documentation-platform) written in C#.

### Repository Structure
* __OneSkyAppSharp__: This is the main library project that contains all implemented OneSky API calls.
* __OneSkyAppTool__: This is a console app project that can be used to automate build processes by downloading localization files using the OneSky API.

### Dependencies
* [__RestSharp__](http://restsharp.org/)

### State of the library
Because this library is mainly developed for my own purposes, only the functions I personally use are currently implemented. However, pull requests are very welcome!
